guys i ve finish the basic functions of drawer navigation and created three screens. Please edit them under the src/component folder and keep everything including img/styles under the src folder as well. Currently the drawer bar is shown afrer rightswift. i ll add more features but you can start adding your codes in. please also check if it's good in android simulator since i tested it on Xcode only.
